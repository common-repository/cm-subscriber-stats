== Description ==

This plugin pulls data from your Campaign Monitor lists' feeds and displays them on your WordPress dashboard.

CM Subscriber Stats was built with white-labelers in mind, and it's possible to remove virtually all mention of Campaign Monitor so you can promote your own services.

See [the CM Subscriber Stats project page](http://dialect.ca/code/cm-subscriber-stats/) for details.
